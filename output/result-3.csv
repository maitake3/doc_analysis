order avoid attribute discrimination must make directly proportional marginal costs whether base instead difference marginal costs choice horn dilemma two major type fully distribute cost analysis double-step type despite ambiguity due failure clearly define relative costs '' exposition fully distribute costing go far one go toward express basic philosophy practice explicit exposition one must distinguish different type analysis means important distinction total-cost apportionment superimpose distribution admittedly unallocable cost residue estimate incremental marginal costs apportionment recognize difference true cost allocation mere total-cost distribution first double-step type might also call railroad type '' application railroad transportation agency cost section interstate

energy number customer necessarily linear function already note earlier paragraph familiar cost analysis utility enterprise utility system divide total costs among number major class service

industrial power service example would charge maintenance costs capital costs low-tension distribution line major portion total costs utility business common joint nearly class customer costs must somehow apportion among various class must somehow reapportion among unit service order report unit costs serve tentative measure reasonable rates general basis common costs assign differently measure unit service illustrate following highly simplify problem electric-utility cost analysis turning example must distinguish two subtypes analysis belong single-step type rather double-step type first subtype analyst following practice railroad analysis particular respect distribute total operate costs total annual capital costs include allowance cost capital '' fair rate return '' among different class unit service apportionment $5,000,000 total costs residential service class would include allowance perhaps per cent cost whatever capital deem devote service residential consumer second subtype take one frequently apply operate expense cost capital '' fair return '' apportion directly among various class service sure capital investment alternatively estimate fair values '' plant equipment apportion among different class also gross revenue receive sales different services result excess revenue receive given class service operate costs impute class report return '' realize capital investment attribute service thus given revenue residential service $7,000,000 b operate expense impute class service come $5,000,000 c investment value plant equipment deem devote service amount $30,000,000 cost analyst report residential service aggregate yield return $2,000,000 6-2/3 per cent services show different rates return probably much lower higher obvious reason convenience practice exclude cost capital '' direct apportionment annual costs among different class service notably avoidance controversial question rate return hold constitute cost capital '' fair rate return '' practice likely mislead since may seem support conclusion long revenue class service cover impute operate expense plus return capital investment however low rates charge service compensatory needle inference would quite unwarranted reason suggest shall assume use first subtype fully distribute cost apportionment following simplify example allowance cost capital '' assume include directly cost apportionment three-part analysis costs electric utility business order simplify exposition typical fully apportion cost analysis let us assume application analysis electric utility supplying single city power generate steam-generation plant let us also assume existence one class type service supply voltage phase etc. residential commercial industrial customer latter assumption permit us center attention controversial aspect modern public utility cost analysis distinction among costs function output service measure along different dimension since review supplying regard one kind service might suppose problem total cost apportionment would simple indeed would limited finding total annual operate capital costs business follow calculation total terms annual cost per kilowatt-hour consumption fact however problem simple statement costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore fact many costs function kilowatt-hour output consumption energy recognition multiple cost function therefore require simple division one frequently use subdivision gas electric rate case threefold division total operate capital costs customer costs '' energy '' volumetric costs '' demand '' capacity '' costs threefold division costs counterpart actual rates charge service actually rates would result three-part rate one class service example monthly bill residential consumer might sum $1 customer charge $5 charge 250 kilowatt-hours energy per kilowatt-hour $2 charge maximum demand kilowatt month rate $1 per kilowatt total bill $8 month present interest lie measurement costs service indirectly rates may may design cover costs let us therefore consider three type cost turn recognize simplify classification use illustrative purpose costs actually vary much complex ways customer costs operate capital costs found vary number customer regardless almost regardless power consumption include minimum costs meter billing along whatever expense must incur taking another consumer minimum costs may come $1 per month le residential small commercial customer although substantially higher large industrial user require costly connection meter devices costs order sometimes separately charge residential commercial rates form mere service charge '' frequently wholly partly cover minimum charge entitle consumer small amount gas electricity payment really controversial aspect customer-cost imputation arise cost analyst frequent practice include costs definitely earmark incur benefit specific customer also substantial fraction annual maintenance capital costs secondary low-voltage distribution
