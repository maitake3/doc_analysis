        "text": "If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? We may feel pessimistic at the outlook . And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision . We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music . And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith . Atomic energy To see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom . You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima . It was only about the size of a baseball ; ; but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of Aj . That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; ; and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem . Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world . But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb . Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce . We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ; water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ; there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies . I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima . I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion . And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond . Salt water is still Af , the same hydrogen is there . And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today . Of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture . For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days . And think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make . With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years . Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come . It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere . An octillion atoms Now let us see where this power comes from . To grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is . I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry . One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; ; and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ? I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; ; that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number . Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ; a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ; a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ; and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia . I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania . Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ; so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep . You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas . But we still have a long way to go . Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; ; then we have sextillion peas . Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ; and then we have septillion . Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; ; we get 250,000 planets ; ; we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body . So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are . A speck -- and space Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it . Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill . I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me . I shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long . Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside . And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs . These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone . Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom . So you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin . This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus . Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead . It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; ; it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy . You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space . And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too . If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper . Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing . At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are . Music of the spheres Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture . For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; ; and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ; and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts . So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ; and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine . And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom . And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists . Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's . A suggestion from Louis De Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves . And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today . Now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it . These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral . And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music . It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony . Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ; and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe . And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music . The Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State . Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living . The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ; the rest is obtained from harbor scallops . During about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ; ; but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime . This is a fine trip , too , on a good day . With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours ."

        "text": "`` Suppose you take Mr. Hearst's morning American at $10,000 a year '' , Brisbane proposed . `` You could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors . If within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter . Of course , if you don't make the American a success , Hearst will have no further use for you '' . The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York , and the deal fell through . Hearst's luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin K. Lane , a prominent California journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support . Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner . Hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to Lane , ended on a tart note . `` Mr. Lane '' , Hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that I can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done '' . `` Mr. Hearst '' , Lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery '' . Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New York to become a father . On April 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named George after the late Senator . Hearst saw his wife and child , sent a joyful message to his mother in California , and soon returned to Washington , where on April 22 , for the first time , he opened his mouth in Congress . This was not before the House but before the Judiciary Committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly . Attorney Shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York . Hearst had spent more than $60,000 of his own money in the probe , but still Attorney General Knox was quiescent . Six of the railroads carrying coal to Tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields , Hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines . They had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20,000,000 in annual profit . `` The Attorney General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months '' , Hearst said . `` He has not acted in any way , and won't let anyone take it away from him . What I want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it , as I am very sure he won't , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , I then wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence . '' The Congressman tried hard , but failed . This was the very sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself had in mind . There can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington , overt or implied , to block anything Hearst wanted , even if it was something good . Hatred tied his hands in Congress . Roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley . They were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the Presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses . He might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in Congress . He was the House pariah . Even the regular Democrats disowned him . Inherently incapable of cooperating with others , he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line Democratic toes he stepped on . He was a political maverick , a reformer with his own program , determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him . He showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular Democrats . He sought to run Congress as he ran his New York American or Journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted . For a freshman Congressman to read political Lessons to graybeard Democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends . He soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the House , and came to be regarded with detestation by regular Democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline . To old-line Democrats , the Hearst Presidential boom , now in full cry , was the joke of the new century . Yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant T. R. a semblance of a race . There was talk of dragging old ex-President Cleveland out of retirement for another try . Some preferred Judge Alton B. Parker of New York . There was a host of dark horses . The sneers at Hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country . Platoons of Hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention , and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading . Just when it was needed for the campaign , Hearst Paper No. 8 , the Boston American , began publication . A Bay State supporter said , `` Mr. Hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in Boston '' . His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat . He ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction '' , `` rape '' , `` abortion '' , `` criminal assault '' and `` born out of wedlock '' . In a story headed , `` Hearst Offers Cash '' , the Republican New York Tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed `` Hearst supporter '' as saying : `` The argument that is cutting most ice is that Hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected . The Hearst men say that if Hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the Democratic National Committee the sum of $1,500,000 . This , it is urged , would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates . The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless . The average Democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office . It has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of Mr. Hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the Hearst bandwagon '' . If anything , the conservative Democrats were more opposed to Hearst than the Republicans . In his own state of New York , the two Democratic bellwethers , State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy , were saying nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , Murphy being for Cleveland and Hill for Parker . They had lost twice with the radical Bryan , and were having no part of Hearst , whom they considered more radical than Bryan . But his increasing strength in the West looked menacing . It caused Henry Watterson to sound a blast in his Louisville Courier-Journal : `` Does any sane Democrat believe that Mr. Hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected President of the United States ? ? But there is a Hearst barrel . '' More splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee , a Parker man . `` The nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin of the party '' , Carmack said . `` It would be a disgrace , and , as I have already said to the people of Tennessee , if Hearst is nominated , we may as well pen a dispatch , and send it back from the field of battle : ' All is lost , including our honor ' '' . A lone pro-Hearst voice from New York City was that of William Devery , who had been expelled as a Tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district . `` I understand [ Hearst ] is a candidate for Presidential honors '' , Devery said without cracking a smile . `` There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up . If he's going to the St. Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it . He's got a lot of friends , and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help '' . Hearst won the Iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker , drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W. Kern : `` We are menaced for the first time in the history of the Republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the Presidential nomination . Our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers . As for the paid Hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their duty , I have nothing but contempt . The Hearst dollar mark is all over them . '' The talk of a Hearst `` barrel '' was increasing . Another Indiana observer later commented , `` Perhaps we shall never know how much was spent ( by Hearst ) , but if as much money was expended elsewhere as in Indiana a liberal fortune was squandered '' . In his fight for the Illinois and Indiana delegations , Hearst made several trips to Chicago to confer with Andrew Lawrence , the former San Francisco Examiner man who was now his Chicago kingpin , and once to meet with Bryan . On one visit he stopped at the office of the American , where he was known surreptitiously as `` the Great White Chief '' , and for the first time met his managing editor , fat Moses Koenigsberg . Koenigsberg never did learn what Hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door . `` Never mind , thank you '' , he said . `` I must hurry to catch my train '' . Another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , `` But Mr. Hearst , what shall I do with this correspondence '' ? ? `` I'll show you '' , Hearst replied , grinning . He took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket . `` Don't bother . Every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks '' . 2 . The Hearst `` barrel '' Hearst hopped into a private railroad car with Max Ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression . He laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated . `` I should , of course '' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate me . But I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat . I have supported the Democratic party in the last five campaigns . I supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice . I intend to support the nominee of the party at St. Louis , whoever he may be '' . The Hearst press followed the Chief's progress at the various state conventions with its usual admiring attention , stressing the `` enthusiasm '' and `` loyalty '' he inspired . This was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an American Presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land . Yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value . When Nan Patterson , a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a Floradora road show , rode down Broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover , Frank Young , she stopped the cab to disclose that Young had been shot dead , tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so ."

        "text": "This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` Homecoming Day '' . They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes . The football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor's lions . It is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the Christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team . Even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them . More often than not , as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain . He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall . Undergraduates It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat . Usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by . His dream goes . He feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him . His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous . His bifocals blur . His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths . Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth . It is not much better if he meets with old classmates . Too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by . He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him . If they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done . After all , when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it . Middle-aged spread By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread ; ; the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy ; ; the fading signs of old beauty ; ; the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on . It is , if anything , worse on the old player He sits in the stands and he doesn't like that . Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd . He always feels lonely . A team feels something . On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him . In the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him . He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped ; ; the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants ; ; the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face . He remembers the desperate , panting breath ; ; the long runs on the kick-offs ; ; the hard , jolting tackles ; ; the breakthrough ; ; the desperate agony of goal-line stands . And so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth . But it is no use . It is gone . No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again . Since the obvious is not always true , the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities . Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more , Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14 . There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election . These are New York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Maryland , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois and Minnesota . In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower won all but Missouri . Yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr. Kennedy . Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia . Mr. Nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so . His visit to Warsaw , Poland , after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial . Yet , the GOP breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` Polish '' vote ; ; 30 per cent of the `` Irish '' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` Negro '' vote . ' task force ' A GOP `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities . The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders . These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment . This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one '' , and not a reality . The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical . They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics , which the GOP declared it to be . The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery . Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing , a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point . If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities . Errors repeated The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s . In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover , and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash . The Republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble . Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` Hoover carts '' . Smokers reduced to `` the makings '' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` Hoover dust '' . One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error . But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy . That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business . The most articulate Republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy , already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care . If they also defeat the school bill , the GOP task force won't have much research to do . It will early know why the party won't win back city votes . The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider . The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner . After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative Forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history . Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions . Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever . And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor's race '' ? ? How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations ? ? The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual . But when former Gov. Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov. Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November , the situation was aggravated . Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation . To have refused would have been political suicide . And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside . The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates . It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' . But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no , and he didn't mince any words . `` They are just asking too much '' , he said . We can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either . There are other dangers : Politics is an accelerating game . `` If an opponent accuses you of lying , don't deny it . Say he is a horse thief '' , runs an old adage . These men are spenders . If either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end . Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths . The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one . Why not have them travel the state in November debating ? ? It would present a forum for them in almost every community . But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin . There is a way out of this . The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum . It has arranged a campaign for governor . If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state . But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race . Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a `` great soldier '' . Ike's somewhat like George Washington . Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy . Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President Kennedy so much , they're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice -- and give up his program . Slogan of the John Birch Society : `` Paddle your own canoe . The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist '' . A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election on the religious issue . Too many people were afraid if the GOP won , they'd have to spend all their time praying ."

        "text": "If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching . The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention . His point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms . The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' . But this statement is completely unconvincing . If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world . In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed . Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class . Time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious . The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected . However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians . But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ? Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ? Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ? There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world . By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church . But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it . And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men . Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends . In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction . But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition . If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian . Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ; and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us . To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann . It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the Chicago School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! ! ) Tillich as well . Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead . What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world . Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity . They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him . When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement . However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . Whereas Bultmann's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false . Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann . A second point requires more extended comment . It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological ."

        "text": "Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Austin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . One validated acts of school districts . Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed . One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . Austin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . Austin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . `` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts '' . Austin , Texas -- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . `` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover . College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . Paris , Texas ( sp. ) -- The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president . Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma . He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A & I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla. . In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology . During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College . He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army . Denton , Texas ( sp. ) -- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . `` Must solve problem '' The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy ."

        "text": "Control of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle- to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . School principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods . Subjects Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . Therefore , third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study . For purposes of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade population in each school system . The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution , one-third as underachievers , one-third medium , and one-third over-achievers . Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection . Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system . The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores . Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases , 87 boys and 69 girls . Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls . Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools . It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation . Rating scale of compulsivity An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . The parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and , as much as possible , to record the parents' actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations . The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records . Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms . Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals . The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters . For instance , the following statement was rated low in compulsivity , `` She's naturally quite neat about things , but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy . But she cleans it up very well when I remind her '' . Measurement of anxiety Castaneda , et al revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use with children . The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety . There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees . Reliability and validation work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale . Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . Relationship of Anxiety to compulsivity The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . The two ratings yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . In theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later . Criterion measurement In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement . The Stanford Achievement Test , Form J , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting of a battery of six sub-tests : Paragraph Meaning , Word Meaning , Spelling , Language , Arithmetic Computation , and Arithmetic Reasoning . All of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation . Scores are stated in grade-equivalents on a national norm . The battery median grade-equivalent was used in data analysis in this study . The Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker . The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact ( in this case , Af ) ; ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement . It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q. . For example , on the basis of the regression equation , a child with an I.Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) . If a child with an I.Q. of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be , representing of one year of over-achievement . A child with an I.Q. of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5 . If such a child scored 3.0 , his discrepancy score would be -.5 , representing of one year of under-achievement . In this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables . Results test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable . Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically . First of all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( Af ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools . It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( Af ) . No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school . The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level . While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives . Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment . It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work . When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . Test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group . As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools . The interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( Af ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom . The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . According to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple . As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements . Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved . By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words . Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked . Sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . Observers , in the two school systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting . Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting ."

        "text": "Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . Guilford-Martin personality inventories . The three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . Some predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5% level ( Af ) . One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not . The nonreactors had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' nonreactors and `` secure '' reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies . It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` Inferiority '' factor . All of the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who shifted in Conditions 3 , or 4 . A t test on these two groups , shifters vs. nonshifters , gave a `` t '' value of 2.405 which is significant on the two-tail test at the level . Discussion individual differences Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study . Only 27% ( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon . There were 49% ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration . There were 24% ( 10 subjects ) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction . Among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred . One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax . Five subjects ( 12% ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration . Four subjects ( 10% ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not . At no time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject's initial reaction was deviant . The subjects were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction . Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion . This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it . These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried . The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility ( if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues ) . In no way , either verbally or behaviorally , did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction . Moreover , when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed , the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation . They continued to give an arm-elevation . A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion . Autosuggestibility , the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e. , that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening ( e.g. , of becoming dizzy and maybe falling , an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects ) . A suggestion Hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave . While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had , they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had . There was no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation . A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax , since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as `` normal '' . The naive state , Condition 1 , , could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting one for 24% of the subjects in this study . They were not free to be themselves in this situation , an interpersonal one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior . Instructions to relax , i.e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given . While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior . Alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried ) . This subject , who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years , did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while sober . After two drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely . There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement . She described herself as having the same kind of `` irresponsible '' feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis . She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls . Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it . These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had . The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control . They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors . They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction . Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily . One subject spontaneously asked ( after her arm had finally risen ) , `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before '' ? ? Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ; I thought it wasn't supposed to '' . This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first . She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing . She explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax '' . When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it '' . In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects , the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity . They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level . The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects ; ; but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation . One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen '' . She then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control . However , she was able to relax and yield to the moment . It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors . It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below . Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor . Aniseikonic illusion The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world . There was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline . This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill . They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses . Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be . The change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations . They were able to experience at first , in terms of past conventionality . When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present . It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong ; ; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise . While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion ."

        "text": "She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . She never hid the fact that she liked to play . Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial '' . It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot ( Mickey ) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl . ( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls . ) Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course . She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns . It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best . Clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : `` This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society . `` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County . In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him . `` At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey . He was the official procurer for King Farouk , now in exile . She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty . She lied in order to get it . `` We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country . She has been acting as a prostitute . `` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' . Diane sobbingly denied this to the court . `` That's a lie . I never gave that boy a cent . I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend '' , she said . During the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement . `` Diane is the type of girl '' , Jelke said , `` who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor '' . But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends '' . She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor '' instead of a chaperone . As she told it , `` He's a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 '' . She was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive . She had talked her `` boy friend '' into sending her to New York to take a screen test . The screen test was never made -- but Diane was . She quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business . She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke . An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield , the famous producer '' . The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows . `` I'd love to audition for you '' , she gushed . The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment . She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance . After a few minutes he said , `` I can't use you if you dance like that . I'd like to see you dance nude '' . She hastily complied . Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again . She developed another quaint habit . Even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique . When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` If you go home now , I'll scream '' . More often than not he would bow to the inevitable . One who needed no such threats was a French financier . One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel . She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday . In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her . `` Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers '' . The Greek evidently fell for her , `` Monsieur X '' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables . She could do no wrong at the tables that time . And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way . Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris . No one ever learned what happened to the Greek . The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome . She teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious . To climax her Roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help . It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night . Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental . `` There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors . `` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent . The hotel staff , as well as residents of the Excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall . `` They were wearing nothing but their scratches . They were asked to leave the hotel . No charges were filed '' . The girls , after dressing , were indignant . `` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed . `` We are Americans '' . In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador . With the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad . Of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do . By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world . She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt . A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way : `` It was a strange relationship . Pulley Bey spoke no English . Diane spoke no Italian or French . She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet . `` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continued . It seemed as though she were always auditioning . No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key . She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her . Tewfik Badrawi , Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company . `` So extensive became her circle of admirers '' , Egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust '' . The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world , but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down . When Farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , Pulley Bey . They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport . The cagey Pulley Bey , who spoke no English , had taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the country without his approval . Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United States . And return to the United States she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office . Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio's , an excellent Italian restaurant . Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney . With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York . It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington '' . Several years ago she married a Houston business man , Robert Graham . She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia . Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring . Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute . The next time the police saw her she was dead . It was September 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles . She had had a party with a regular visitor , Dr. William W. McClellan . McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died . He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time . When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police . When the police arrived , they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently . The blonde's nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her . Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls . An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body . Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her . `` I think that maybe she wanted it this way '' , a vice squad cop said . `` A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date . She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens . At least she never knew what the bottom was like '' . I am a carpet salesman . I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East . We cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores . I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting . There is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream . From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare . People come to me with confidence . They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little . But I knowingly abuse their confidence ."

        "text": "Note : Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery . Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given . Equipment : Basic pottery studio equipment . Wooden butter molds and cookie presses . Materials : Ceramic modeling clay : red , white or buff . Stoneware clay for tiles . Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions . General directions : Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking . Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; ; they must be free of oil , wax and dust . Pressing designs : The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed . Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions . Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay . When mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns . Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) . Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold . To obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges . Trim excess clay away from outer edges . Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay . Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles . Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) . To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold . Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold . Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action . This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired . Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off . Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections . If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers . If the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush . Make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) . Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping . Rectangular tiles ( opposite page , right top ) : Stoneware clay was used . Clay was rolled to 1/4'' '' thickness . Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping surface . No bisque firing . Glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware glaze ( no glaze on sides or bottom ) . Decorated on unfired glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors ; ; raised details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green , blue-green , brown and pink . Tiles were fired once to cone 05 . Round plaque ( opposite page , bottom ) : White clay was used , rolled to 1/4'' '' thickness . Bisque fired to cone 05 . Stained with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired stain , polished , following manufacturer's directions . Opaque cantaloupe and transparent wood brown were used . No further firing . Paperweight ( opposite page , top left ) : Red clay was used , rolled 1/2'' '' thick . Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife at about 45-degree angle , to form an undercut , making base smaller than the pattern top . While clay is still pressed in mold , press three equally spaced holes 1/4'' '' deep , using pencil eraser , in bottom of clay to allow for proper drying and firing . Paperweight may be personalized on back while clay is leather hard . Bisque fired to cone 05 . Unglazed . Jars with lids ( opposite page , top left ) : Remove wooden design head from bowl of butter mold . Fill small hole in bowl with clay . Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid ( see Fig. 1 , opposite page ) . Measurements for rectangular pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl . Pattern for circular base piece B is diameter of Aj . Use wooden design head of mold for pattern C ; ; pattern D for lid fits over top diameter of Aj . Pattern for inner lid piece E fits inside Aj . Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold . Use white or buff clay , rolled to 3/16'' '' thickness . Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position . Place clay pieces on wall board . To assemble jar , put paper pattern B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk B on top . Line sides of mold with paper pattern Aj . Bevel and score ends of clay piece A so that they overlap about 1/2'' '' and make even thickness . Place clay piece A inside ; ; use slip to join overlapped ends together . Join B to bottom of A , scoring and reinforcing with clay coil . Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while assembling lid . To assemble lid , press clay piece C in cavity of wooden design head . Press clay into mold as instructed in General Directions . Score plain side of C and leave in mold . Score one side of disk D , join to C ; ; score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before . While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board . If design head has a deep cavity , clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; ; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' '' deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing . Check fit of lid on jar ; ; if inner lid is too big , trim to fit , allowing room for thickness of glaze . Remove lid from head of mold . Remove jar from mold . Place jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly . Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar . For an antique effect on jars , brush Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off . Glaze with two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze . The large jar was brushed with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off . Glaze with two coats of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid . When dry they were fired to cone 06-05 . Little folks set : ( Made from modern wooden molds Af . ) Roll white clay to 3/16'' '' thickness . Salt and pepper : Use mold to cut four side pieces . For top and bottom pieces , use short end of mold as measurement guide . Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold . Trim excess clay from rim of mold . Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45-degree angle to miter corners . Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold ; ; place design-side up on plaster board . Make all four sides . Cut clay top and base pieces ; ; place on plaster board . Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing shaker . To assemble : Construct sides , bottom and top as for box , using slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce seams . Join the four sides together first , then add the base ; ; add top last . Use water on finger to smooth seams and edges . Turn shaker upside down . Recess base slightly to allow room for stopper . Cut hole in base for cork stopper . Add holes in top , forming `` S '' for salt and `` P '' for pepper . Set aside to dry thoroughly . Sugar and creamer : Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold design . Press clay into cavity of one mold three times ; ; bevel overlapping ends for splice joint , score beveled edges . Form clay strip into a cylinder ; ; use slip to join scored ends . Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder . Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to disk with slip . Trim away excess clay ; ; reinforce seam with a coil of clay . This will form the sugar bowl . Make creamer the same . Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' '' wide and 3-1/2'' '' long . To add handle , place a wooden dowel against the inside wall of creamer . Score outside of container where handle ends will be joined . Bend handle ; ; press scored handle ends firmly in place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing ; ; use slip to join . To form spout , between two designs , dampen area slightly and gently push clay outward . Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids , omitting design disk . Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired . Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl . Vases : Make same as salt and pepper shakers , leaving off top pieces . Vases may be made into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick . Napkin holder : Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about Af ( long enough for three impressions of mold ) . Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three times . Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard state . Score side edges of base ; ; join sides and base with slip and reinforce with coil . A cardboard pattern cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping . Place pattern inside holder ; ; use three strips of clay to hold in place ( see Fig. 2 , page 71 ) . Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would cause breakage . Let all projects dry slowly for several days . Clean greenware . Bisque fire to cone 08 . Inside of pieces was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze . Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique finish . Fired to cone 06-05 .

        "text": "After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure . There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century . I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg . In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) . It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on . But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired . For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ? The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you're not quite the people to say it '' . In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North . At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South . The line is a pretty good one . People talk about `` the law of the land '' . The expression has become quite a cliche . But people can't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law . I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat . They didn't seem to be able to think of any . A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) . Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; ; it can be changed ; ; it has been , many times . Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter . Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! ! ) and was repealed . The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history . The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' . The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look . How do we define it '' ? ? Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ? Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' . To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' . Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ? That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ? That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ? Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? ? Circumstances alter cases . A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell . He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere . I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's . One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! ! Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance . The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything . You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England . New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West . They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South . It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England . A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; ; that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' . I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith . I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are . I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally . If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ? ) , what voices would be left ? ? Who is involved willy nilly ? ? Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left . And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction . A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' . Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's `` Massachusetts To Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' . There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' . And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves . Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value . Complicity is an embarrassing word . It is something which most of us try to get out from under . Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I didn't do anything , did I '' ? ? Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in `` Brother To Dragons '' : `` The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption . A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him . Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' . He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil '' . Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade . After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ? It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds . But didn't they get off too easy ? ? The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care . Emerson -- Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . Who is the owner ? ? The slave is owner , And ever was . Pay him '' ! ! It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . Like Pilate , they had washed their hands . But can one , really ? ? Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago . The New England conscience became desensitized . George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' . It was nice to be able to isolate it . New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation . There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States . Why should this be so ? ? It is true that New England , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ? ? Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A & M colleges ? ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A & M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? ? Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? ? The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' . He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools . And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! ! I don't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises . One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children . In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory ."
